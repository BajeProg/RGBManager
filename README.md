# RGB Manager
___
## About
:arrow_right: The program is designed to be able to change the backlight color of your devices  
:arrow_right: The program is better than standard utilities thanks to additional functions, such as changing the color to the beat of the music and setting the color of the backlight to match the color of the screen
___
## Solution
When using a PC, I encountered the problem that the "music" mode did not work in the asrock polychrome sync utility. At the same time, it was not possible to set the backlight to match the color of the screen. To solve this problem, I developed my own program
___
## Possibilities
The program has four modes of work:
+ Static
+ Screen
+ Music
+ Rainbow
___
## Modes
### Static mode
This mode of operation sets one static color on all your devices
### Screen mode
This mode of operation sets the median color of your screen pixels
### Music mode
This mode of operation changes color to the beat of the music
### Rainbow mode
This mode of operation smoothly changes color to all colors of the rainbow
___
## In future
- [ ] Add all standard modes
- [ ] Add different modes of light music
- [ ] Speed up the algorithm for finding the median color on the screen
